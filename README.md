This project developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CNNs are the gold standard for image recognition due to their ability to learn hierarchical features (edges → textures → patterns → objects). Using TensorFlow/Keras, we constructed a model with convolutional layers (for feature extraction), max-pooling layers (for dimensionality reduction), and dense layers (for classification). The PyTorch implementation offered more flexibility for customization.

The model achieved ~75% accuracy, with visualizations showing how filters detected edges and colors in early layers and complex shapes in deeper layers. Techniques like normalization and dropout helped prevent overfitting. We also explored transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models like ResNet, which boosted accuracy to over 90%.

CNNs are ubiquitous in modern AI applications: autonomous vehicles (object detection), healthcare (MRI analysis), security (facial recognition), and agriculture (crop monitoring). This project provided hands-on experience with hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and the trade-offs between TensorFlow's simplicity and PyTorch's flexibility. All experiments were run on Google Colab’s free GPU resources, making advanced deep learning accessible without expensive hardware.
